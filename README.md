# bootstrap_website_apple
Tried to make the apple website using the bootstrap studio. To check out how fast a responsive website can be generated using bootstrap without spending too much time on documentation; Used official bootstrap studio website tutorial for it(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDjTBn7orFg). 
Here is the website hosted in github>>>https://sachsom95.github.io/bootstrap_website_apple/
